## Ch - 2 Supervised vs Unsupervised Machine learning

### What is Machine Learning ?

> Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ~ _Arthur Samuel_

There are 3 main types of Machine learning

1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning

2. Hybrid learning problems
3. Statistical Inference

### Superivsed learning

> It refers to algorithms that learn `x` to `y` or **input** to **output** mappings.
>
> The key characterstic of superivsed learning is that you give your learning algorithm examples to learn from, which includes the right answers (`y`) for a given input (`x`), and is by seeing correct pairs of input `x` and desired output label `y` that the learning algorithm eventually learns to take just the input alone without the output label adn gives a reasonably accurate prediction or guess the output. ~ _Andrew Ng_

In Supervised learning, the algorithm maps the input data with output labeled data and guess the output on new input based on the mapping.

Example:
| Application | Input `X` | Output `Y` |
| :--------------------: | :-------------: | :---------: |
| Email spam detection | Emails | spam or not |
| Image Classification | Images (mixed) | Cat / Dog |
| Self-driving car | Images, sensors | move or not |
| House price prediction | Area, floors | Price |

#### Regression algorithm

> In Regression algorithm, we try to predict a number from infinitely many possible numbers such as house prices, which could be `123,000`, `280,000` etc... ~ _Andrew Ng_

We use **Regression** algorithm to predict quantitative (continuous) data, data in numbers.

Example:

1. Predicting house prices
2. Bitcoin value
3. Deaths in COVID etc...

#### Classification algorithm

> In Classification algorithm, the learning algorithm has to make a prediction of a category, all of a small set of possible outputs. Example: Cat or Dog ~ _Andrew Ng_

We use **Classification** algorithm to predict qualitative (categories/classes) data, data having different categories.

-   In classification, we define boundaries by drawing lines which divide the data into different classes.

Example:

1. Breast Cancer (Yes / No) (Malignant / bengin)
2. Image recognition (Cat or Dog)

|           Application           | Regression | Classification |
| :-----------------------------: | :--------: | :------------: |
|         Price of Stock          |     ‚úÖ     |       ‚ùå       |
| Stock will Increase or Decrease |     ‚ùå     |       ‚úÖ       |
|        Species of Plant         |     ‚ùå     |       ‚úÖ       |
|        Fake news or not         |     ‚ùå     |       ‚úÖ       |
|      Temperature on Sunday      |     ‚úÖ     |       ‚ùå       |

### Unsupervised learning

> In unsupervised learning, data only comes with inputs (`x`), but not output labels (`y`). Algorithm has to find some **structure** or some **pattern** in the data.
>
> In Unsupervised learning, we input data (`x`) that isn't associated with any output labels (`y`), instead, our job is to find some structure or some pattern or just find something interesting in the data. ~ _Andrew Ng_

In **Unsupervised learning**, we use the algorithms to identify patterns in unlabelled data, i.e. we didn't label whether the provided images is of **cat** or **dog**, algorithm has to identify patterns itself.

<img src="./images/unsupervised.jpg" width="500px" alt="unsupervised">

Example:

-   Mixed and unlabelled pictures of Cats and Dogs
-   Google news
-   Finding spam emails from mixed emails.
-   Recommendation system (YT, Netflix)

#### Clustering algorithm

> Group similar data points together
>
> An unsupervised algorithm, might decide that the data can be assigned into two different groups or two different `clusters`. This algorithm is known as **Clustering** algorithm. ~ _Andrew Ng_

Clustering means grouping the similar data together into clusters.

#### Types of Unsupervised learning

1. Anomaly detection

<img src="./images/anomaly-house-price.png" width="500px" alt="anomaly-house-price">

-   It is used to detect **unusual events**.
-   Example:
    Fraud detection in finanical system, where unusual events, unusual transactions could be signs of fraud.

2. Dimensionality reduction

-   It takes a big dataset and magically compress it to a much smaller dataset while losing as little information as possible.

|           Application            | Supervised | Unsupervised |
| :------------------------------: | :--------: | :----------: |
|       Weather Forecasting        |     ‚úÖ     |      ‚ùå      |
|          Spam Detection          |     ‚úÖ     |      ‚ùå      |
